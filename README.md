Hey, I'm StarlitNova, or simply Nova! I'm an enthusiastic C++ developer, tending to make games and programming languages in C++. I participate in events such as Advent of Code, and game jams. You may find a wide assortment of repositories on this profile, and as this has no intention of being a business profile you may look at any of my old repositories, maybe even see how I've grown over the years. If you wish to contact me, join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/r4BfjWRWsj) or contact me via dms, @starlitnova.
